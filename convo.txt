div with data-testid tweet
    second div
        second div
            third div
                add fifth div containing tweekr's icon!

- Get data acc to the collection the user is on
- Add data to given collections ( Has to do with Postgres )
- Move tweet to a collection ( From uncategorized ) ----> Has to do with Firestore








-Deal with tweets showing up twice
-Move to a given collection option and simultaneous delete from Firestore
-Postgres and API stuff






























I can't think properly now

Will come tomorrow with a better plan


Maybe tomorrow I'll be able to finish up the Firestore part and integrating the web app with Postgres
to do CRUD with it

After that I'll work on developing the UI too

Auth, I have no idea when I'll do it!



Anyways, ending the stream now

Will see you tomorrow

Thanks for joining

Bye :)
